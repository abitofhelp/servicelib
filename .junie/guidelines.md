This project follows the following coding guidelines:
* You will explain decisions and design choices before implementing them.
* The architecture combines the best practices from Domain-Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, and Hexagonal Architecture, creating a hybrid model that leverages the strengths of each.  All code must adhere to these designs.
* The codebase is written in Go, following best practices and conventions.
* Any function requiring a context parameter must have a context.Context parameter as the first argument and use ContextLogger to log messages.
* You must use Testify for assertions in tests.
* You must use GoMock for mocking in tests.
* You must not implement testing for the /examples folder.
* Implement unit tests for each package and when a new Go file is added.  The target is a minimum of 80% coverage of statements.  
* Unit tests should be fast, must exist in the same folder as the file being tested, and isolated from each other.
* Implement integration tests for each package as needed to adhere to best practices, with a minimum of 80% coverage of statements.
* Always use exhaustive error detection and handling, including retries and timeouts, where appropriate.
* Always update .svg files when updating .puml files.
* Always update the relevant.puml files whenever the architecture changes or code changes.
* Always update the documentation whenever there are relevant architecture changes or code changes.  This includes /docs, and any relevant .md files throughout the packages in the codebase.
* Do not embed examples in the documentation.  Rather, link to them in /examples.
* All new or existing README.md files must adhere to the COMPONENT_README_TEMPLATE.md structure.
* Every package must have a README.md file, even if it is empty.

The project must follow these godoc guidelines, which are based on best practices and conventions:
1. Document Exported Identifiers:
   Rule: Every exported identifier (functions, types, variables, constants) should have a doc comment.
   Reason: godoc generates documentation from these comments, and well-documented exported elements are crucial for understanding and using your package.
2. Follow the Comment Format:
   Rule: Place doc comments directly above the declaration they describe.
   Reason: godoc uses this proximity to associate comments with the correct elements.
3. Start the Comment with the Identifier's Name:
   Rule: The first sentence of a doc comment should begin with the name of the documented element.
   Example: // Reader serves content from a ZIP archive.
   Reason: This convention makes the documentation easily readable and allows godoc to generate a synopsis.
4. Use Full Sentences:
   Rule: Write doc comments using complete, grammatically correct sentences.
   Reason: Full sentences improve readability and formatting in the generated documentation.
5. Explain the "Why," Not Just the "What":
   Rule: Focus on explaining the purpose, intent, and non-obvious aspects of your code.
   Reason: Redundant comments that simply rephrase the code's action are unhelpful.
6. Use Package-Level Documentation:
   Rule: Include a package-level comment (usually in doc.go) that provides an overview of the package's purpose and contents.
   Reason: This gives users a high-level understanding of what the package does.
7. Add Examples:
   Rule: Include runnable examples in your tests (Example... functions) to demonstrate how to use your code.
   Reason: These examples are automatically included in the godoc output and serve as practical demonstrations.
8. Use gofmt:
   Rule: Always run gofmt on your code.
   Reason: This ensures consistent formatting, which is crucial for godoc and overall code readability.
9. Be Concise and Clear:
   Rule: Write doc comments that are easy to understand and avoid unnecessary complexity.
   Reason: Concise and clear documentation is more likely to be read and used.
10. Include "BUG(who)" Comments (when appropriate):
    Rule: For known issues, use the // BUG(who): format.
    Reason: godoc specifically recognizes these comments and includes them in a separate "Bugs" section.
    By adhering to these principles, you'll create clear, informative documentation that is easily discoverable and usable via godoc.
