   - **Justification**: Immutability helps prevent bugs related to unexpected state changes.

## Context Usage
The project follows best practices for context usage:

1. **Context as First Parameter**:
   - **Finding**: Functions that require a context parameter have context.Context as the first argument (e.g., in auth/service/service.go).
   - **Justification**: This follows Go conventions and makes it clear that the function accepts a context.

2. **ContextLogger Usage**:
   - **Finding**: Functions that use logging pass the context to the logger methods (e.g., s.logger.Debug(ctx, ...)).
   - **Justification**: This allows the logger to include context-specific information in log messages.

3. **Context Propagation**:
   - **Finding**: Context is properly propagated through function calls, allowing for proper cancellation and timeout handling.
   - **Justification**: Proper context propagation is essential for managing request lifecycles and preventing resource leaks.

4. **Context Cancellation**:
   - **Finding**: The code checks for context cancellation and returns appropriate errors (e.g., in retry/retry.go).
   - **Justification**: Checking for context cancellation ensures that operations can be properly canceled or timed out.

## Testing Practices
The project follows good testing practices:

1. **Testify for Assertions**:
   - **Finding**: Tests use the Testify library for assertions (e.g., assert.Equal, assert.NotNil, assert.Error).
   - **Justification**: Testify provides a rich set of assertion functions that make tests more readable and maintainable.

2. **GoMock for Mocking**:
   - **Finding**: Tests use GoMock for creating mock objects (e.g., in db_test.go, repository_test.go).
   - **Justification**: GoMock allows for creating mock objects with specific behaviors, making tests more isolated and focused.

3. **Table-Driven Tests**:
   - **Finding**: Tests use table-driven testing to cover multiple test cases efficiently (e.g., in auth/service/service_test.go).
   - **Justification**: Table-driven tests reduce code duplication and make it easier to add new test cases.
