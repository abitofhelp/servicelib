//
// This package contains various tools that help with development workflows, code generation,
// documentation maintenance, and other tasks that support the development process. These tools
// are not intended to be imported as libraries but are meant to be used as standalone utilities
// during development.
//
// The tools directory includes:
//   - readme_fixer: A utility for fixing and standardizing README.md files
//   - readme_validator: A utility for validating README.md files against templates
//   - generate_svg.sh: A script for generating SVG diagrams from PlantUML files
//
// These tools help maintain consistency across the codebase and automate repetitive tasks,
// making it easier to follow project standards and conventions.
//
// Note: The tools in this package are not part of the public API and are not intended
// to be used by consumers of the servicelib library. They are development utilities only.
