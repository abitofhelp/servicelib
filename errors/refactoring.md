# Errors Package Refactoring

## Overview

The errors package has been refactored to improve maintainability, reduce redundancy, and enhance the overall architecture. This document describes the changes made and the new structure of the package.

## New Package Structure

The error handling package is now organized into several sub-packages:

- `core`: Core error handling functionality
  - Error codes and constants
  - Error context structures and functions
  - Basic error utility functions (Is, As, Unwrap, etc.)
  - HTTP status code mapping

- `types`: Specific error types
  - Validation errors
  - Application errors
  - Domain errors
  - Repository errors
  - Not found errors

- `interfaces`: Error interfaces for type checking and HTTP status mapping
  - ErrorWithCode
  - ErrorWithHTTPStatus
  - ValidationErrorInterface
  - ApplicationErrorInterface
  - RepositoryErrorInterface
  - NotFoundErrorInterface

- `recovery`: Error recovery mechanisms
  - Circuit breakers
  - Retries
  - Fallbacks

- `utils`: Utility functions for error handling
  - Error formatting
  - Error comparison
  - Error serialization

- `wrappers`: Error wrapping utilities
  - Context enrichment
  - Stack trace capture
  - Error chaining

## Key Improvements

1. **Reduced File Size**: The main errors.go file has been split into smaller, more focused files, making it easier to navigate and maintain.

2. **Consistent Interfaces**: All error types now implement consistent interfaces, making it easier to check error types and extract information.

3. **Centralized Error Codes**: All error codes are now defined in one place (core/error_codes.go), reducing duplication and ensuring consistency.

4. **Enhanced Error Context**: The error context system has been improved to provide more detailed information about errors, including source location, operation name, and custom details.

5. **Better HTTP Status Mapping**: Error codes are now consistently mapped to HTTP status codes, making it easier to return appropriate responses in web applications.

6. **Improved Type Safety**: Error types are now more strongly typed, reducing the risk of runtime errors.

## Backward Compatibility

The refactoring has been done in a way that maintains backward compatibility with existing code. All public functions and types from the original errors package are still available with the same signatures.

## Usage Examples

The usage examples in the README.md file are still valid and demonstrate how to use the errors package. The underlying implementation has changed, but the public API remains the same.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to the errors package could include:

1. Adding more error recovery mechanisms
2. Enhancing error serialization for different formats (JSON, XML, etc.)
3. Adding support for error localization
4. Improving integration with logging systems
5. Adding more specialized error types for common scenarios
